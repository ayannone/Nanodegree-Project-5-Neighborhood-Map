Welcome to Project 5 - Neighborhood Map Project


Quick start "How to use this app":

- Search for any location: enter a city name or address, e.g. "Hamburg, Germany" or "New York City", hit the Enter key or click on the Search button.

- This app shows you the 30 coolest places retrieved from Foursquare for your location, in the list right next to the map (laptop/desktop/tablet) or under the map (smartphone) and indicated through markers on the map.

- You can filter the list by typing a search string that matches the places title in the list, e.g. the search string "park" will filter the list for all entries that contain "park" in their title.

- When you hover over a list entry, the corresponding map marker will animate and an infowindow opens with a picture of the place, a link to the places website and, if available, a short description.

- When you click on a list entry you get redirected to the Foursquare website where you find more information about this place.

- When you click on a marker it will animate and open the infowindow for this place as well.

- Beneath the map you find a picture slider with up to 40 location images from Flickr moving around in an endless loop. Swipe left or right on a mobile device to scan through them or click on the arrows on a laptop or desktop. When you click on an image it opens itself in original format in a new browser window.

- Beneath the picture slider you find another slider with reviews from Yelp about different places at your location. These reviews are not linked to the places in the list, but provided to you as additional inspiration or ideas where you might want to go when you visit this location. Click on the link "read more on Yelp" to learn more about each reviewed place on Yelp.

Thank you and have fun!!!
